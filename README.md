The point is: collect the data, choose AI model and train it.
During the research i`ve analyzed the selection,
have learned new types of models, have choosen three

Parser for auto.ru:
Parser for collecting data about cars parameters and prices for AI model training. 
Now parser collects minimal data, but in the future for improvement browsing each car can be added.

Tasks for future:
